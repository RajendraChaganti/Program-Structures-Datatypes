# Program-Structures-Datatypes

##  Aim :
To take input from the user for different basic data types in C++ (like int, float, char, etc.) and show how much memory each one uses in bytes.

## Tools :
GNU g++ compiler for local and code editor or Online C++ Compiler.

## Program Explanation :
- The program starts by including the necessary headers: <iostream> and <string>.
- It declares variables for different data types:  
  int, float, double, char, bool, long, short, and string.
- The user is asked to enter a value for each data type.
- After all inputs are taken, the program shows the size (in bytes) of each data type using the sizeof() function.
- For the string, it also shows how many characters were entered using .length().

## Key Concepts :
- **cin** is used to get input from the user.
- **sizeof()** shows how much memory (in bytes) a variable uses.
- **string.length()** gives the number of characters in the entered string.
- Helps understand how C++ handles memory for different types of data.

## Conclusion :
This program is a simple way to learn about the basic data types in C++, how we take input for them, and how much memory they take. It builds a strong foundation for understanding how data is stored and managed in C++ programs.
